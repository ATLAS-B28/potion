# Elixir and Erlang Learning Repo
## Erlang 
Erlang is a programming language used for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems. It is particularly well-suited for telecommunications, real-time systems, and other applications requiring high availability and reliability. Its concurrency model and built-in support for distributed computing make it a popular choice for building robust and resilient systems.

## Elixir
Elixir is a programming language used for building scalable and maintainable applications. It is particularly well-suited for building distributed, fault-tolerant, and real-time systems. Elixir runs on the Erlang VM (BEAM) and leverages the Erlang ecosystem, making it a great choice for building highly concurrent and resilient applications. It is commonly used for web development, IoT, and other distributed systems where high availability and fault tolerance are important.
