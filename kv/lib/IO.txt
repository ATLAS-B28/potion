File operations
The File module contains functions that allow us 
to open files as IO devices. By default, files 
are opened in binary mode, which requires 
developers to use the specific IO.binread/2 
and IO.binwrite/2 functions from the IO module

The majority of the functions in the File 
module expect paths as arguments. Most commonly, 
those paths will be regular binaries. 
The Path module provides facilities for
working with such paths
