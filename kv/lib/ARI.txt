alias: The alias keyword is used to 
create an alias for a module. This allows 
you to refer to the module using a shorter
name. For example: 

alias MyApp.User

user = User.new()e:

require: The require keyword is used to specify 
that a module is required for compilation. 
This is useful when you want to use macros or 
functions that are defined in the module. 
For example:

require MyApp.User

user = MyApp.User.new()

import: The import keyword is used to bring 
specific functions or macros from a module 
into the current scope. This allows you to 
call the functions or macros directly without 
prefixing them with the module name. 
For example:

import MyApp.User

user = new()
